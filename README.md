# CounterCurate


Code coming soon... for the data curation pipeline of both physical and semantic counterfactual image-caption pairs.

Our paper is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13254

In our paper, we used Flickr30k-Images and PointQA-LookTwice (which used the Visual Genome dataset). If you want to test out CounterCurate, you must download these two datasets from their authors.
Download Flickr30k-Images [here](https://shannon.cs.illinois.edu/DenotationGraph/); download VisualGenome [here](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/api.html).
